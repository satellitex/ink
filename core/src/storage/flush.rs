/// Types that are able to flush their state into the contract storage.
///
/// # Note
///
/// Many types support caching of their state into memory to avoid costly
/// contract storage reads or writes. When execution of a contract is finished
/// or interrupted (e.g. due to calling a remote contract) we have to flush
/// all cached state into the contract storage.
///
/// # Implementation Hints
///
/// Caching types provided by ink! are `SyncCell` for caching of a single data
/// and `SyncChunk` for caching an array of data.
///
/// All abstractions built upon them that do not have their own caching mechanism
/// shall simply forward flushing to their interiors. Examples for this are
/// `storage::Vec` or `storage::Value`.
pub trait Flush {
    /// Flushes the cached state back to the contract storage, if any.
    ///
    /// # Note
    ///
    /// Needs to take `self` by `&mut` since `SyncChunk` and `SyncCell`
    /// and potentially other abstraction facilities are required to
    /// write back their cached values which is a mutable operation.
